Called Woolworths Insurance. On hold for a while due to recent storms.

Eventually the call was taken by, Amber. A claim was raised and given the following number
* 823246

## Phone Record
Amber told me that she would escalate the payout limit on the road bike, and that I was required to show evidence of the actual bike cost.

All details of items that have been stolen are to be sent to 
* claims@hollard.com.au

Details should include age and price of items.

She is going to arrange the garage door to be fixed, and was going to have someone come out to look at it today.
