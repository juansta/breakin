## Phone Record
Amber told me that she would escalate the payout limit on the road bike, and that I was required to show evidence of the actual bike cost.

All details of items that have been stolen are to be sent to
* claims@hollard.com.au

Details should include age and price of items.

She is going to arrange the garage door to be fixed, and was going to have someone come out to look at it today.

Called Woolworths Insurance. On hold for a while due to recent storms.

Called as we have not heard back from anyone in regards to getting the garage door replaced.

## Phone Record (Woolworths Insurance)
Spoke to Raj, who put me on to their booking team (after being on hold until 16:05). Unsure why this wasnt done on the first contact at 08:32.

## Phone Record (Builders Booking Team - Claims Central)
Spoke to Alisha (at 16:05), but no information was attached as normally would. Things like police report number wasnt even included. So I had to run through the entire event again. She was unsure as to why this happened.

She told me the earliest an assesor could come out would be 27th between 1pm and 2pm. She assured me that a 24hr response was set so as to make the garage door 'safe' again, this 24hr response would start from the time I placed this last call, not my original 08:30 phone call.

After speaking to one of her superiors she determined that it is probably easiest if we could do a live stream sometime tomorrow (20th April) instead. Need to download **Live Logic**, she will SMS me a time slot for the stream. Im unable to find **Live Logic** in the Playstore. During the phone call she asked me if I had an iPhone and was surprised I didnt... Will check that Android application is available instead.

She also let me know the following links between all the different companies;
* Woolworths Insurance contract out to **Claims Central** for building repairs
* Woolworths Insurance contract out to **Hollard** for contents replacement, although **Claims Central** also have a contents department

Phone conversation ended at 16:25.

Called Woolworths Insurance. On hold for a while due to recent storms.

Called to determine why our claim was not handled properly.

## Phone Record
Spoke to Dom, he let me know that Amber had probably set incorrect expectations in that no-one would be able to contact me on the same day to arrange for the garage door to be fixed. He said that they were flat out with other claims due to cyclones and other weather events, which really doesnt not concern us. This is the only explanation he could provide as to why there was no details forwarded to **Claims Central**.

# 20th April 07:40
Called Claims Central (Claims 360) on 1300 743 673 to find out the exact application I have to download as I cant seem to find **Live Logic**.

## Phone Record
Found out the office doesnt open until 8am. Will have to ring back then.

# 20th April 8:20
Called Claims Central (Claims 360) on 1300 743 673 found out application link would be sent to me over SMS. Called **LiveLogik**.

# 20th April 9:05
Tried to open live stream to assessor. Unable to carry it out due to poor internet connectivity, even over 4G.

# 20th April 10:00
Stopped all background processes running on phone and managed to create a decent quality stream for Nicholas (assessor).

## Phone Record
This was carried out, I showed him all the required areas, from what he could see, the door was too damaged (due to buckling on the lower sections of the track) and requires a replacement. I also showed him images of outside the house for when their team arrives to replace the door. I stepped out the width of the door and estimated it to be just under 6m.

About 5 minutes after talking to Nicholas, Alisha rang to confirm a new appointment for an assessor to come out. During the phone conversation she received an email from Nicholas stating no assessor visit was required as he was happy with the stream we carried out.

# 1st May 15:15
Rang woolworths insurance back to see how the claim was progressing. They have had my contents claim list for over a week (sent to them on 22 Apr) and Claims Central had already let me know (on 20 Apr) that they had approved my claim.

## Phone Record
Spoke to Moheed (spelling?). We went through the entire list and invoices together. I was surprised to learn that I was required to go through everything with him over the phone as I had sent woolworths the list of items over a week ago. I dont think anyone looked at anything until this phone call.

In either case, there were discrepencies which he was not going to accept, these included;
* 1 cent on Aldi purchased lights
* $4 on delivery fees with CyclingDeal
* $10 on Bunnings tote box

He was also unable to find the Cell bikes Shimano pedals, eventhough the item number is clearly listed in the **Notes** column they provide within their template. He was also not understanding the fact that some items are now more expensive due to;
1. Items not being on special
2. Items requiring shipping fees
3. Items no longer being available

He also requires proof that I owned some of the gifted items, including;
* Cycling Glasses
* Makita Drill

Im now required to find photos of me wearing the glasses and using the drill! More time I am required to sink to this.

He did apologise for the lack of progression on my claim. He also let me know that there was a limit imposed on the total sum insured depending on the item types (especially bikes and tools-of-trade), and that there was an avenue for complaints that I could follow to escalate this further. Infact, he asked me to check out other insurance companies to see if they do they same!

Phone call lasted 60min.

## Claim Central
Shortly after my phone call to woolworths insurance, I received an SMS from Claims Central stating that my claim had been approved.

# 3rd May
Received a missed call from a private number. No idea if this was related to any insurance claim or not. I am hoping that they would also send me an email, or an SMS to let me know it was them who rang.

## Phone Record
Missed call at 9:44am.

## Follow Up
Still have not received confirmation of anyone trying to ring. Perhaps the phone call was not insurance related.

# 5th May
Received a missed call from a private number (11:17) so I rang woolworths insurance. After a 20min hold time I Was put through to Shana (spelling?).

## Phone Record
Shana let me know that they had received my email on the 2nd May but that nothing had actually been looked at. She said she was going to look at it today and give me a call back in a few hours.

I also asked her about the garage door, and when that would be fixed. She advised me that I would need to deal with the ‘building company’. They apparently tried to ring me, and had sent out a scope of works in the mail. She has updated them to let them know they can email the documents instead.
