Called Woolworths Insurance. Was told by Kathryn that it was best to call back when the claims department was opened. This would be the following day at 8:30 am.

Called Woolworths Insurance. On hold for a while due to recent storms.

Eventually the call was taken by, Amber. A claim was raised and given the following number
* 823246

## Phone Record
Amber told me that she would escalate the payout limit on the road bike, and that I was required to show evidence of the actual bike cost.

All details of items that have been stolen are to be sent to 
* claims@hollard.com.au

Details should include age and price of items.

She is going to arrange the garage door to be fixed, and was going to have someone come out to look at it today.

Called Woolworths Insurance. On hold for a while due to recent storms.

Called as we have not heard back from anyone in regards to getting the garage door replaced.

## Phone Record (Woolworths Insurance)
Spoke to Raj, who put me on to their booking team (after being on hold until 16:05). Unsure why this wasnt done on the first contact at 08:32.

## Phone Record (Builders Booking Team - Claims Central)
Spoke to Alisha (at 16:05), but no information was attached as normally would. Things like police report number wasnt even included. So I had to run through the entire event again. She was unsure as to why this happened.

She told me the earliest an assesor could come out would be 27th between 1pm and 2pm. She assured me that a 24hr response was set so as to make the garage door 'safe' again, this 24hr response would start from the time I placed this last call, not my original 08:30 phone call.

After speaking to one of her superiors she determined that it is probably easiest if we could do a live stream sometime tomorrow (20th April) instead. Need to download **Live Logic**, she will SMS me a time slot for the stream. Im unable to find **Live Logic** in the Playstore. During the phone call she asked me if I had an iPhone and was surprised I didnt... Will check that Android application is available instead.

She also let me know the following links between all the different companies;
* Woolworths Insurance contract out to **Claims Central** for building repairs
* Woolworths Insurance contract out to **Hollard** for contents replacement, although **Claims Central** also have a contents department

Phone conversation ended at 16:25.

Called Woolworths Insurance. On hold for a while due to recent storms.

Called to determine why our claim was not handled properly.

## Phone Record
Spoke to Dom, he let me know that Amber had probably set incorrect expectations in that no-one would be able to contact me on the same day to arrange for the garage door to be fixed. He said that they were flat out with other claims due to cyclones and other weather events, which really doesnt not concern us. This is the only explanation he could provide as to why there was no details forwarded to **Claims Central**. 

# 20th April 07:40
Called Claims Central (Claims 360) on 1300 743 673 to find out the exact application I have to download as I cant seem to find **Live Logic**. 

Found out the office doesnt open until 8am. Will have to ring back then.
