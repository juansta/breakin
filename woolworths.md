Amber told me that she would escalate the payout limit on the road bike, and that I was required to show evidence of the actual bike cost.

All details of items that have been stolen are to be sent to
* claims@hollard.com.au

Details should include age and price of items.

She is going to arrange the garage door to be fixed, and was going to have someone come out to look at it today.

### Time 15:35
Called Woolworths Insurance. On hold for a while due to recent storms. Called as we have not heard back from anyone in regards to getting the garage door replaced.

Spoke to Raj, who put me on to their booking team (after being on hold until 16:05). Unsure why this wasnt done on the first contact at 08:32.

## Phone Record (Builders Booking Team - Claims Central)
### Time 16:05
Spoke to Alisha, but no information was attached as normally would. Things like police report number wasnt even included. So I had to run through the entire event again. She was unsure as to why this happened.

She told me the earliest an assesor could come out would be 27th between 1pm and 2pm. She assured me that a 24hr response was set so as to make the garage door 'safe' again, this 24hr response would start from the time I placed this last call, not my original 08:30 phone call.

After speaking to one of her superiors she determined that it is probably easiest if we could do a live stream sometime tomorrow (20th April) instead. Need to download **Live Logic**, she will SMS me a time slot for the stream. Im unable to find **Live Logic** in the Playstore. During the phone call she asked me if I had an iPhone and was surprised I didnt... Will check that Android application is available instead.

She also let me know the following links between all the different companies;
* Woolworths Insurance contract out to **Claims Central** for building repairs
* Woolworths Insurance contract out to **Hollard** for contents replacement, although **Claims Central** also have a contents department

Phone conversation ended at 16:25.

## Phone Record (Woolworths Insurance)
### Time 16:40
Called Woolworths Insurance. On hold for a while due to recent storms. Called to determine why our claim was not handled properly.

Spoke to Dom, he let me know that Amber had probably set incorrect expectations in that no-one would be able to contact me on the same day to arrange for the garage door to be fixed. He said that they were flat out with other claims due to cyclones and other weather events, which really doesnt not concern us. This is the only explanation he could provide as to why there was no details forwarded to **Claims Central**.

# 20th April
## Phone Record (Claims Central)
### Time 07:40
Called Claims Central (Claims 360) on 1300 743 673 to find out the exact application I have to download as I cant seem to find **Live Logic**.

Found out the office doesnt open until 8am. Will have to ring back then.

## Phone Record (Claims Central)
### Time 08:20
Called Claims Central (Claims 360) on 1300 743 673 found out application link would be sent to me over SMS. Called **LiveLogik**.

## Phone Record (Claims Central)
### Time 09:05
Tried to open live stream to assessor. Unable to carry it out due to poor internet connectivity, even over 4G.

## Phone Record (Claims Central)
### Time 10:00
Stopped all background processes running on phone and managed to create a decent quality stream for Nicholas (assessor).

This was carried out, I showed him all the required areas, from what he could see, the door was too damaged (due to buckling on the lower sections of the track) and requires a replacement. I also showed him images of outside the house for when their team arrives to replace the door. I stepped out the width of the door and estimated it to be just under 6m.

## Phone Record (Claims Central)
### Time 10:30
After talking to Nicholas, Alisha rang to confirm a new appointment for an assessor to come out. During the phone conversation she received an email from Nicholas stating no assessor visit was required as he was happy with the stream we carried out.

# 1st May
## Phone Record (Woolworths Insurance)
### Time 15:15
Rang woolworths insurance back to see how the claim was progressing. They have had my contents claim list for over a week (sent to them on 22 Apr) and Claims Central had already let me know (on 20 Apr) that they had approved my claim.

Spoke to Moheed (spelling?). We went through the entire list and invoices together. I was surprised to learn that I was required to go through everything with him over the phone as I had sent woolworths the list of items over a week ago. I dont think anyone looked at anything until this phone call.

In either case, there were discrepencies which he was not going to accept, these included;
* 1 cent on Aldi purchased lights
* $4 on delivery fees with CyclingDeal
* $10 on Bunnings tote box

He was also unable to find the Cell bikes Shimano pedals, eventhough the item number is clearly listed in the **Notes** column they provide within their template. He was also not understanding the fact that some items are now more expensive due to;
1. Items not being on special
2. Items requiring shipping fees
3. Items no longer being available

He also requires proof that I owned some of the gifted items, including;
* Cycling Glasses
* Makita Drill

Im now required to find photos of me wearing the glasses and using the drill! More time I am required to sink to this.

He did apologise for the lack of progression on my claim. He also let me know that there was a limit imposed on the total sum insured depending on the item types (especially bikes and tools-of-trade), and that there was an avenue for complaints that I could follow to escalate this further. Infact, he asked me to check out other insurance companies to see if they do they same!

Phone call lasted 60min.

## Phone Record (Claims Central)
### Time 16:15
Shortly after my phone call to woolworths insurance, I received an SMS from Claims Central stating that my claim had been approved.

# 3rd May
## Phone Record
### Time 09:44
Received a missed call from a private number. No idea if this was related to any insurance claim or not. I am hoping that they would also send me an email, or an SMS to let me know it was them who rang.

# 5th May
## Phone Record (Woolworths Insurance)
### Time 11:17
Received a missed call from a private number (11:17) so I rang woolworths insurance. After a 20min hold time I Was put through to Shana (spelling?).

Shana let me know that they had received my email on the 2nd May but that nothing had actually been looked at. She said she was going to look at it today and give me a call back in a few hours.

I also asked her about the garage door, and when that would be fixed. She advised me that I would need to deal with the ‘building company’. They apparently tried to ring me, and had sent out a scope of works in the mail. She has updated them to let them know they can email the documents instead.

# 9th May
## Phone Record (Woolworths Insurance)
### Time 11:57
Finally received a call back from Woolworths Insurance (11:57). It was Shana returning the phone call from Friday.

Shana let me know that they have agreed to the updated pricing I have sent them, **excepting** for the amount claimed on the bicycle. I told her I was not happy about this and that I wanted to escalate the complaint.

I again explained to her how the **Certificate Of Insurance** issued to me only mentions limits within the **Optional Covers** section, the total sum insured does not make any mention of limits at all. So why are they imposing limits now? She explained that she did not write the **Certificate Of Insurance**, I dont know why that is relevant as I was on the phone to **Woolworths Insurance**, who prepared the **Certificate Of Insurance** for me.

She did offer to payback a partial settlement amount, which would not include the bike. I told her this was not acceptable (and pointless) and that I would rather receive the entire claim as a single settlement.

I also explained to her that I had not received any scope of works from their building contractors. She was going to chase that up for me. Her notes indicated that she had already sent them an email detailing my email address. I guess I will receive the scope of works via snail mail before any email comes through.

## Email Communication (Claims Central)
Received email from Claims Central in regards to the scope of works.

The email requires us to sign off on the Scope Of Works and to provide an excess payment of $1,000. Im not sure why we are required to pay Claims Central as our insurance policy is with Woolworths.

## Phone Record (Woolworths Insurance)
### Time 17:30
I tried to get hold of Woolworths Insurance to ask them why we are required to pay an external third party an excess. Their office hours are 8am to 5pm.

Surely they cant expect multiple excess payment from a single insured event!

# 11th May
## Phone Record (Woolworths Insurance)
### Time 09:25
Rang Woolworths Insurance to ask about ClaimCentral's request for excess payment. On hold for a while due to recent weather events.

Spoke to Curtis and he confirmed that there is only one excess required for the home and contents claim, which is payable directly to Claim Central.

## Email Communication (Claims Central)
Sent email with signed SOW and excess paypal receipt.

# 12th May
## Phone Record (Woolworths Insurance)
### Time 12:15
Received a phone call from Woolworths Insurance (12:15) in regards to the limits applied on the bicycle.

Spoke to Tamara, and she exaplined that the limits are applied based on the PDS. The total sum insured that is displayed on the **Certificate of Insurance** that they offered does not count for anytyhing essentially. This would also be the case for a complete insurable event.

Unfortunately, this is not how the **Certificate of Insurance** reads. To me, the reference to the PDS imposed limits are only made when describing **Optional Covers**, to which I have none of. Perhaps it is the indentation of their paragraphs.

She will be sending me an email describing all of this. She also said that she was the highest person I could talk to in regards to claims, so I am not sure how much further I can escalate this.

## Phone Record (Claims Central)
### Time 17:15
Berny from Claim Central contacted me on my mobile. He explained that we have now progressed along in the claims process, and will be contacted within 7 working days to confirm the remaining items (colour, type, etc) with their approved builder. I also mentioned to Berny the fact that we have plans to leave our house for a holiday soon and would like this sorted before then. He made a note of this, but assured that it should not take that long.

## Phone Record (Steel Line Doors)
### Time 12:15
Received a phone call from the builder in regards to coming out to look at the garage door.

We arranged for him to come out today (between 15:00 and 15:30) to have a look at what was required.

# 23rd May
## Phone Record (Claims Central)
### Time 08:46
I spoke to Hackan who was confirming that I had spoken to the builder in regards to the works.

I let him know that the garage door person had come out to quote and would be getting back to the with a price. I also let him know about the urgency of the job and its requirement to be completed by the 22nd June.

## Email Communication (Claims Central)
I also received an email from Claim Central stating that the works had been completed. However, works have not even begun at my house.

This lead me to ring Claim Central.

## Phone Record (Claims Central)
### Time 16:06
I spoke to Bernie. He confirmed that this email (and SMS) was a glitch in their system and that someone must have closed off the claim by accident. He also confirmed that he could see no works had been carried out, and assured me that the claim was still opened in their system. He assured me that the claim would not be *forgotten* or deleted from their system.

# 29th May
## Phone Record (Claims Central)
### Time 16:06
Tried to ring Robert from Steel Line Doors (0402 352 676) to find out how the claim was going.

Could not get through and left a message for a call back.

## Email Communication (Claims Central)
After leaving the phone message, I received an email from Hakan confirming that nothing has changed and work is set to commence on the 5th of June.

# 30th May
## Phone Record (Woolworths Insurance)
### Time 08:30
Received a phone call from Woolworths insurance asking how my claim had progressed.

It was a very bad line and I could not distinguish the name on the other end. The number that contact me was (02) 8867 6861. I explained to them that the claim had been escalated to hollard insurance, but he was surprised that everything had taken so long.

He assured me that someone would rng me back with more information regarding my claim.

## Email Communication (Steel-Line Doors)
Received an email from **Steel-Line** doors stating that the doors are not due in Sydney until the Week commencing the 5th June. From this date, the Sydney branch will get deliveies on Wednesday or Friday.

I have asked Elizabeth Bryen <ebryen@steel-line.com.au> to book an isntallation date for the following week, but have not heard anythign in response.

# 2nd June
## Phone Record (Woolworths Insurance)
### Time 09:10
I rang Woolworths Insurance to find out how my claim was progressing. I spoke to Martin who confirmed that the claim was now being handled by the Internal Dispute Resolution team. He spoke to the while I was on hold and they assured him they would respond by Close Of Business today.

I also mentioned the issue I was having with the garage door installation date. He then spoke to Claims Central (Holly) and they assured him that the door was expected to be finliased on the 5th of June. Installation could then commence between the 12th and 16th of June.

## Email Communication (Internal Dispute Resolution Committee)
### Time 09:23
After the phone conversation, I received an email from Judy Bray. The email stated that they had 45 days to resolve the dispute. This is in slight contradiction to Tarama's original email, which stated that "we will inform you of the outcome within 15 working days of receiving your complaint".

# 13th June
**Garage door installed.**

# 6th July
## Phone Record (Woolworths Insurance)
### Time 14:26
Received a phone call from Woolworths Insurance to finalise settlement. I spoke to Lilian, who was going to email me a final settlement figure. She said that I would then be required to forward bank details to them so they can finalise the transfer.

I received an email from Lilian a few minutes later. Unfortunately, the email stated an incorrect settlement amount and also mentioned an excess payment of $1000! Refer to previous phone records (11th May) but woolworths insurance have previously told me that only a single excess payment is required.

## Time 15:21
I rang Woolworths Insurance to talk about the final settlement and now the additional excess requirement.

I spoke to Curtis, and unfortunately, Lilian was not available. He had a quick review of the claim, but thought it best to properly sit down with Lilian and go over it all. They will send me an email ersponse either this afternoon or tommorrow morning... What's another day...
